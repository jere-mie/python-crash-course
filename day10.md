# Day 10 ~ Final Project

For the final project, you will create a program that can analyze and display data from a CSV file. The project should incorporate the concepts and skills you have learned throughout the course, including file I/O, data structures, and functions. Here are some guidelines for the project:

## Project Idea: CSV Data Analysis

Create a program that can read in a CSV file and display the data in a meaningful way. The user should be able to select which columns of data to display and in what order. The program should be able to calculate and display basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for the selected columns.

## Requirements

- The program should prompt the user to enter the name of the CSV file to be analyzed.
- The program should read in the file and display the contents to the user.
- The program should prompt the user to select which columns of data to display, and in what order.
- The program should display the selected columns of data to the user.
- The program should calculate and display basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for the selected columns.
- The program should prompt the user to save the data to a new CSV file.
- The program should save the data to the new file, using a file name specified by the user.
- Your program should be well-documented and include comments explaining how the code works.
- Your program should be modular, with functions that perform specific tasks.
- Your program should be error-tolerant, with appropriate error messages displayed when necessary.
- Your program should be user-friendly, with clear prompts and messages displayed to the user.

## Tips

- Start by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Use functions to encapsulate code that performs specific tasks.
- Test your code regularly as you develop it, to catch errors early.
- Use comments to explain what your code is doing, and why.
- This project will challenge you to use many of the skills you have learned throughout the course, including file I/O, data structures, functions, and error handling. Good luck, and have fun!

## Example CSV

Here is a sample CSV file you can use for your testing. You can name it `employees.csv`:

```csv
