# Day 1 ~ Introduction to Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its simplicity and ease of use. It is used by many industries such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and game development.

## Installing Python and a Text Editor/IDE

Before we begin, it is important to install Python and a text editor/IDE (integrated development environment) of your choice. You can download Python from the official website, Python.org, and choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system. For this course, we recommend using Python version 3.x as it is the latest stable version and has many improvements over the previous version.

Once you have installed Python, you will also need a text editor/IDE to write and run your Python programs. Some popular choices include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm. We recommend using a text editor/IDE that provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging features to make your coding experience more efficient.

## Running a "Hello, World!" Program

Now that we have installed Python and a text editor/IDE, let's write our first Python program. Open your text editor/IDE and create a new file called hello_world.py. Type the following code into the file:

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file and run it by opening a terminal/command prompt, navigating to the directory where you saved the file, and typing:

```
python3 hello_world.py
```

You should see the output Hello, World! printed to the console.

## Basic Python Syntax: Variables, Data Types, Operators, and Expressions

Python has many built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Variables are used to store values of these data types, and operators are used to perform operations on these values. Expressions are combinations of variables, data types, and operators.

Here are some examples of Python syntax:

```py
# Variables and data types
age = 25
name = "John"
is_student = True
pi = 3.14159

# Operators and expressions
summation = 2 + 3
difference = 5 - 2
product = 4 * 6
quotient = 10 / 2
remainder = 11 % 2
```

In the above code, we defined variables of different data types and used operators to perform operations on these variables.

## Conclusion

In this article, we introduced Python and its popularity among different industries. We also learned how to install Python and a text editor/IDE and run a "Hello, World!" program. Finally, we covered basic Python syntax, including variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
