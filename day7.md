# Day 7 ~ Exception Handling and Debugging

In Day 7 of our Python journey, we will learn about handling errors and debugging techniques. No matter how experienced we are, writing code that never fails is practically impossible. Therefore, knowing how to handle errors is essential to write reliable and robust code. In this day, we will explore the following concepts:

## Handling errors with try-except

Python provides a mechanism to handle errors or exceptions through the use of try-except blocks. In essence, we try to execute a piece of code that may fail, and if it does, we handle the exception gracefully.

```py
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # code to handle the exception
```

In this code block, we put the code that may raise an exception inside the try statement. If an exception occurs, we handle it in the except block, where we can provide feedback to the user, log the error, or take any other action.

Here are some examples of how we can use try-except blocks:

```py
# Example 1: Catching a division by zero error
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

In this code block, we tried to divide 10 by zero, which would raise a ZeroDivisionError exception. However, we caught the exception and printed a message to the user instead of letting the program crash.

```py
# Example 2: Handling a file not found error
try:
    with open("non_existing_file.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

In this code block, we tried to open a file that doesn't exist, which would raise a FileNotFoundError exception. However, we caught the exception and printed a message to the user.

```py
# Example 3: Catching multiple exceptions
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this code block, we caught a specific ZeroDivisionError exception in the first except block. However, if any other exception occurs, we catch it in the second except block and print a generic error message that includes the exception information.

## Raising exceptions

We can also raise exceptions in our code using the raise statement. This is useful when we detect an error that we cannot handle ourselves, and we want to pass the error to the caller of the function.

```py
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero!")
    return x / y
```

In this code block, we defined a function that checks for a division by zero and raises a ValueError if that happens.

## Debugging techniques

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating task, but it is an essential part of programming. Here are some common techniques for debugging Python code:

### Print statements

One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is to add print statements to your code. This allows you to see the value of variables and the flow of execution at different points in your program.

For example:

```py
def calculate_area(radius):
    print("Calculating area...")
    area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
    print("Area calculated.")
    return area

print(calculate_area(5))
```

In this example, we've added print statements before and after the area calculation to help us understand what's happening in the function.

### Debugging tools

Python comes with a number of built-in tools for debugging, such as the pdb module. Pdb allows you to step through your code line by line, set breakpoints, and examine variables at any point during execution.

For example:

```py
import pdb

def calculate_area(radius):
    pdb.set_trace()
    area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
    return area

print(calculate_area(5))
```

In this example, we've added a breakpoint using the pdb.set_trace() function. When the program runs, it will stop at this point and allow us to examine the value of the radius variable, step through the code, and perform other debugging tasks.

### Error messages

Python error messages can be cryptic and difficult to understand, but they often provide valuable information about the source of the error. Take the time to read and understand error messages, and use them to guide your debugging efforts.

For example:

```py
def divide(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: division by zero!")
    else:
        return result

print(divide(5, 0))
```

In this example, we've added a try-except block to handle the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when dividing by zero. The except block prints an error message that tells us exactly what went wrong.

By using these techniques, you can more easily identify and fix errors in your Python code. Remember that debugging is a skill that takes practice and persistence, but with time and experience, you can become an expert at it.

## Conclusion

Today we covered important topics related to exception handling and debugging. We learned how to use try-except blocks to handle errors in our code, how to raise exceptions when necessary, and various debugging techniques such as print statements, debugging tools, and error messages. These skills are essential for any programmer, as they allow us to write more robust code and quickly identify and fix errors. With practice and persistence, we can become experts at debugging and ensure our programs run smoothly.
